  <p>
  Building FastGit has been an extrodinary journey.
  We met many warm-hearted people who cared about us along the way, as well as those who abused our service.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, all good things must come to an end. Today is the day we choose to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  After today, most of the FastGit services and infrastructure will be shut down and no longer available. Most of GitHub repository will be archived, no longer accept any contribution (PR), issues and queries and no longer be maintained.
  But you can still access and star these repositories.
  <br>
  <br>
  On behalf of all the core team members of FastGit, I would like to express our gratitude and farewell to everyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hope in foreseeable furture, we will meet again.
  <br>
